        "During these labsheets you will find prompts to **hypothesise**, and these can be taken as opportunities to discuss ideas with neighbouring students.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hypothesise (task):** The above image was annotated with `front` and `rear` with respect to the robot chassis.  In theory, the robot can be driven in either direction, regardless of front or rear.  What rationale or justification would you use to support the provided sense of robot direction?\n",
        "  - **help:** consider:\n",
        "    - the task requirements we have of line following.\n",
        "    - the behaviour(s) we might expect from the robot.\n",
        "    - the physical configuration of the hardware.\n",
        "    - the `perception`, `decision making` and `actuation` of the robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "><font color=\"blue\"> It is important to consider the `task requirements` of the robot.  As humans, we might have an intuitive sense for which is the front of the robot - but what leads us to this conclusion? It is useful to interograte our assumptions because these can prevent us from finding interesting or appropriate solutions.  In fact, which side is the front of the robot might change depending on what we need the robot to do.  For Assessment 1, your robot must follow the line.   It is interesting to consider what impact the position of the reflectance (line) sensors might have on the performance of the robot to complete the task.  If the sensors were positioned behind the robot (relative to forward, line following motion), then we could say that the robot will receive historic information about the line.  Remember that, for this type of robot it is able to rotate on the spot.  With the sensors behind the centre of the robot, it would only sense a change in line direction after the centre point of the robot had crossed it.  If the line sensors were directly under the robot, the robot would need to make instantaneous decisions on the line sensor information.  With the sensors ahead of the robot, the robot is able to gain information ahead itself.  </font>\n",

        "2. **Hypothesise (hardware):** The robot has a ball-caster:\n",
        "  - Why might this have been included in the design?\n",
        "  - Why would the ball-caster be more suited at the rear of the robot?\n",
        "  - What is the difference between a ball-caster and a caster-wheel?  \n",
        "\n",
        "> <font color=\"blue\">The ball caster acts as a third point of contact to stabilise the robot.  You will notice the robot can tip forwards, either by adding mass to the robot or with a sudden stop.  If we assume that the robot will most often have forward motion, we can place a single ball caster at the back of the robot.  It might be better to add two ball casters, but here manufacturing cost may have been a factor to consider.  The ball caster offers a low friction contact point.  Other mechanisms, such as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster\">caster wheel</a>, can create complications in the robot motion due to drag - you have probably experienced this with a damaged shopping trolley. </font>\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hypothesise (task):** In these labsheets, exercises will be given to focus on using the 3 central ground sensors.  In what situations might the left-most and right-most peripheral ground sensors be useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "> <font color=\"blue\">We know that the line is expected to be 19mm wide, or similar. This fits neatly within the 3 central sensors whilst the robot is travelling along the line.  The outmost sensors, `DN1` and `DN5` might be useful to detect extreme corners, such as ninety degrees.  We could consider such a sharp corner to be an error state for the robot, as there is no more forward direction of line to follow.  So it would be useful to detect this task environment and/or robot state to intelligently respond to it.</font>"
